Mastermind Game
Please implement a mastermind game, which can be played by a user "against" the computer.
This is a game where a player tries to guess the number combinations. At the end of each
attempt to guess the 4 number combinations, the computer will provide feedback whether the
player had guess a number correctly, or/and a number and digit correctly. A player must guess
the right number combinations within 10 attempts to win the game.
Game rules
- At the start of the game the computer will randomly select a pattern of four different
numbers from a total of 8 different numbers.
- A player will have 10 attempts to guess the number combinations
- At the end of each guess, computer will provide one of the following response as
feedback:
- The player had guess a correct number
- The player had guessed a correct number and its correct location
- The player’s guess was incorrect
Example Run:
Game initializes and selects “0 1 3 5”
Player guesses “2 2 4 6”, game responds “all incorrect”
Player guesses “0 2 4 6”, game responds “1 correct number and 1 correct location”
Player guesses “2 2 1 1”, game responds “1 correct number and 0 correct location”
Player guesses “0 1 5 6”, game responds “3 correct numbers and 2 correct location”
...
**Note that the computer’s feedback should not reveal which number the player guessed
correctly
User Interface
Any type of user interface is acceptable (command line, mobile app, web page etc) but the
player must have a way of interacting with your game including:
- Ability to guess the combinations of 4 numbers
- Ability to view the history of guesses and their feedback
- The number of guesses remaining is displayed

Implementation
- Use Random generator API (https://www.random.org/clients/http/api/) to randomly select
4 numbers from 0 ~ 7 (Duplicate numbers are allowed)
- You can choose whichever combination of programming languages, tools, frameworks,
and libraries you find appropriate within reason (e.g. you can’t use a game framework
that implements Mastermind)
