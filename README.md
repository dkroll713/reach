### Before Installing the App:
Ensure you have [node](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) version 16.16.0 and npm version 8.11.0.

## Installing, Building, and Running the App

To install the app, clone this repository and drag the config file 'config.js' to its root. 

Enter the directory and enter `npm install`.

The bundle file is already built, so once the node module files are installed, run `npm run server`.

This initializes the server, and the app should be available on port 3000.
