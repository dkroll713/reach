## Installing, Building, and Running the App

To install the app, clone this repository and drag the config file 'config.js' to its root. Enter the directory and enter npm install. Once the node modules are installed, enter npm run build. Once it builds, enter npm run start.

The server should initialize, and the app should be available on port 3000.
